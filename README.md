The HomelyHub project using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
stack is designed to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. The
architecture comprises a MongoDB database to store property and user data, while
Express.js handles server-side logic and API endpoints. React is employed for building
the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive experience for property listings
and bookings. Node.js serves as the runtime environment for server-side execution,
ensuring seamless communication between the front and back ends. The project
follows a modular structure, with components for user authentication, property search,
and booking features. Redux is integrated for efficient state management, enabling a
smooth flow of data within the application. Additionally, the project employs RESTful
API principles to facilitate communication between the client and server, ensuring a
scalable and maintainable codebase.
